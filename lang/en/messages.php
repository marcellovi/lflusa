    'aboutus_activities_programs_title_text' => 'In the greater Houston area but not limited to and with the hard work and support from all volunteers and friends, LFL-USA will strive to become in the near future an organization with all infrastructure capable of providing means to help the ones in need: We hold Public Meetings, Lectures, Seminars, and Conferences to discuss Christian teachings; promote book studies envisioning improvement on moral and spiritual values. LFL-USA holds free workshops and art classes on Music, Arts, Culinary, creating a welcoming, friendly, and safe environment in order to provide counseling for (but not limited to) poor people, addictive, and depressed people. LFL-USA also aims to hold free workshops on Meditation and Yoga to support wellbeing and good spiritual health.
                <?br?><?br?>
                            To achieve our goals and support the organization and its charity activities LFL-USA promotes Seminars, Lecturers, Trainings, Bazars, and fundraises.
                            As long as the organization LFL-USA exists, we will strive to perform well because we believe, this is what everybody should do in return to all the blessings we receive: house, job, family, food, education, access to health care, support from friends, family, job and state, etc.
                            <?br?><?br?>
                            While our organization is not connected to any religion, we respect all beliefs based on principles that promote peace and love among all beings. The idea is Integration & Inclusion rather than focusing on labels; remove the barriers between Spirituality & Science; discuss what we call “rationalized faith”.',
